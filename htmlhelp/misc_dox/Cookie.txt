                               HTTP COOKIES

                Preliminary Specification - Use with caution

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                               INTRODUCTION

Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections (such as CGI
scripts) can use to both store and retrieve information on the client side
of the connection. The addition of a simple, persistent, client-side state
significantly extends the capabilities of Web-based client/server
applications.

                                 OVERVIEW

A server, when returning an HTTP object to a client, may also send a piece
of state information which the client will store. Included in that state
object is a description of the range of URLs for which that state is valid.
Any future HTTP requests made by the client which fall in that range will
include a transmittal of the current value of the state object from the
client back to the server. The state object is called a cookie, for no
compelling reason.

This simple mechanism provides a powerful new tool which enables a host of
new types of applications to be written for web-based environments.
Shopping applications can now store information about the currently
selected items, for fee services can send back registration information and
free the client from retyping a user-id on next connection, sites can store
per-user preferences on the client, and have the client supply those
preferences every time that site is connected to.

                               SPECIFICATION

A cookie is introduced to the client by including a Set-Cookie header as
part of an HTTP response, typically this will be generated by a CGI script.

Syntax of the Set-Cookie HTTP Response Header

This is the format a CGI script would use to add to the HTTP headers a new
piece of data which is to be stored by the client for later retrieval.

Set-Cookie: NAME=VALUE; expires=DATE;
path=PATH; domain=DOMAIN_NAME; secure

NAME=VALUE
     This string is a sequence of characters excluding semi-colon, comma
     and white space. If there is a need to place such data in the name or
     value, some encoding method such as URL style %XX encoding is
     recommended, though no encoding is defined or required.

     This is the only required attribute on the Set-Cookie header.

expires=DATE
     The expires attribute specifies a date string that defines the valid
     life time of that cookie. Once the expiration date has been reached,
     the cookie will no longer be stored or given out.

     The date string is formatted as:

          Wdy, DD-Mon-YY HH:MM:SS GMT

     This is based on RFC 850, RFC 1036, and RFC 822, with the variations
     that the only legal time zone is GMT and the separators between the
     elements of the date must be dashes.

     expires is an optional attribute. If not specified, the cookie will
     expire when the user's session ends.

     Note: There is a bug in Netscape Navigator version 1.1 and earlier.
     Only cookies whose path attribute is set explicitly to "/" will be
     properly saved between sessions if they have an expires attribute.

domain=DOMAIN_NAME
     When searching the cookie list for valid cookies, a comparison of the
     domain attributes of the cookie is made with the Internet domain name
     of the host from which the URL will be fetched. If there is a tail
     match, then the cookie will go through path matching to see if it
     should be sent. "Tail matching" means that domain attribute is matched
     against the tail of the fully qualified domain name of the host. A
     domain attribute of "acme.com" would match host names "anvil.acme.com"
     as well as "shipping.crate.acme.com".

     Only hosts within the specified domain can set a cookie for a domain
     and domains must have at least two (2) or three (3) periods in them to
     prevent domains of the form: ".com", ".edu", and "va.us". Any domain
     that fails within one of the seven special top level domains listed
     below only require two periods. Any other domain requires at least
     three. The seven special top level domains are: "COM", "EDU", "NET",
     "ORG", "GOV", "MIL", and "INT".

     The default value of domain is the host name of the server which
     generated the cookie response.

path=PATH
     The path attribute is used to specify the subset of URLs in a domain
     for which the cookie is valid. If a cookie has already passed domain
     matching, then the pathname component of the URL is compared with the
     path attribute, and if there is a match, the cookie is considered
     valid and is sent along with the URL request. The path "/foo" would
     match "/foobar" and "/foo/bar.html". The path "/" is the most general
     path.

     If the path is not specified, it as assumed to be the same path as the
     document being described by the header which contains the cookie.

secure
     If a cookie is marked secure, it will only be transmitted if the
     communications channel with the host is a secure one. Currently this
     means that secure cookies will only be sent to HTTPS (HTTP over SSL)
     servers.

     If secure is not specified, a cookie is considered safe to be sent in
     the clear over unsecured channels.

Syntax of the Cookie HTTP Request Header

When requesting a URL from an HTTP server, the browser will match the URL
against all cookies and if any of them match, a line containing the
name/value pairs of all matching cookies will be included in the HTTP
request. Here is the format of that line:

Cookie: NAME1=OPAQUE_STRING1; NAME2=OPAQUE_STRING2 ...

Additional Notes

   * Multiple Set-Cookie headers can be issued in a single server response.

   * Instances of the same path and name will overwrite each other, with
     the latest instance taking precedence. Instances of the same path but
     different names will add additional mappings.

   * Setting the path to a higher-level value does not override other more
     specific path mappings. If there are multiple matches for a given
     cookie name, but with separate paths, all the matching cookies will be
     sent. (See examples below.)

   * The expires header lets the client know when it is safe to purge the
     mapping but the client is not required to do so. A client may also
     delete a cookie before it's expiration date arrives if the number of
     cookies exceeds its internal limits.

   * When sending cookies to a server, all cookies with a more specific
     path mapping should be sent before cookies with less specific path
     mappings. For example, a cookie "name1=foo" with a path mapping of "/"
     should be sent after a cookie "name1=foo2" with a path mapping of
     "/bar" if they are both to be sent.

   * There are limitations on the number of cookies that a client can store
     at any one time. This is a specification of the minimum number of
     cookies that a client should be prepared to receive and store.
        o 300 total cookies
        o 4 kilobytes per cookie, where the name and the OPAQUE_STRING
          combine to form the 4 kilobyte limit.
        o 20 cookies per server or domain. (note that completely specified
          hosts and domains are treated as separate entities and have a 20
          cookie limitation for each, not combined)
     Servers should not expect clients to be able to exceed these limits.
     When the 300 cookie limit or the 20 cookie per server limit is
     exceeded, clients should delete the least recently used cookie. When a
     cookie larger than 4 kilobytes is encountered the cookie should be
     trimmed to fit, but the name should remain intact as long as it is
     less than 4 kilobytes.

   * If a CGI script wishes to delete a cookie, it can do so by returning a
     cookie with the same name, and an expires time which is in the past.
     The path and name must match exactly in order for the expiring cookie
     to replace the valid cookie. This requirement makes it difficult for
     anyone but the originator of a cookie to delete a cookie.

   * When caching HTTP, as a proxy server might do, the Set-cookie response
     header should never be cached.

   * If a proxy server receives a response which contains a Set-cookie
     header, it should propagate the Set-cookie header to the client,
     regardless of whether the response was 304 (Not Modified) or 200 (OK).

     Similarly, if a client request contains a Cookie: header, it should be
     forwarded through a proxy, even if the conditional If-modified-since
     request is being made.

                                 EXAMPLES

Here are some sample exchanges which are designed to illustrate the use of
cookies.

First Example transaction sequence:

Client requests a document, and receives in the response:

     Set-Cookie: CUSTOMER=WILE_E_COYOTE; path=/; expires=Wednesday, 09-Nov-99 23:12:40 GMT

When client requests a URL in path "/" on this server, it sends:

     Cookie: CUSTOMER=WILE_E_COYOTE

Client requests a document, and receives in the response:

     Set-Cookie: PART_NUMBER=ROCKET_LAUNCHER_0001; path=/

When client requests a URL in path "/" on this server, it sends:

     Cookie: CUSTOMER=WILE_E_COYOTE; PART_NUMBER=ROCKET_LAUNCHER_0001

Client receives:

     Set-Cookie: SHIPPING=FEDEX; path=/foo

When client requests a URL in path "/" on this server, it sends:

     Cookie: CUSTOMER=WILE_E_COYOTE; PART_NUMBER=ROCKET_LAUNCHER_0001

When client requests a URL in path "/foo" on this server, it sends:

     Cookie: CUSTOMER=WILE_E_COYOTE; PART_NUMBER=ROCKET_LAUNCHER_0001; SHIPPING=FEDEX

Second Example transaction sequence:

Assume all mappings from above have been cleared.

Client receives:

     Set-Cookie: PART_NUMBER=ROCKET_LAUNCHER_0001; path=/

When client requests a URL in path "/" on this server, it sends:

     Cookie: PART_NUMBER=ROCKET_LAUNCHER_0001

Client receives:

     Set-Cookie: PART_NUMBER=RIDING_ROCKET_0023; path=/ammo

When client requests a URL in path "/ammo" on this server, it sends:

     Cookie: PART_NUMBER=RIDING_ROCKET_0023; PART_NUMBER=ROCKET_LAUNCHER_0001

     NOTE: There are two name/value pairs named "PART_NUMBER" due to the
     inheritance of the "/" mapping in addition to the "/ammo" mapping.
